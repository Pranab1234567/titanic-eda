# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis – EDA Project

This is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on the **Titanic dataset**, aimed at discovering key survival patterns using Python libraries like `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- Source: `sns.load_dataset("titanic")`
- Target Column: `survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

1. Loaded the Titanic dataset using Seaborn
2. Cleaned missing values (age, embarked)
3. Dropped irrelevant features (deck, embark_town, alive)
4. Performed EDA:
   - Gender vs Survival
   - Class vs Survival
   - Age Distribution
   - Correlation Heatmap
   - Pairplots and Grouped Stats

---

## 📊 Visual Insights

- Women had a higher survival rate than men
- Passengers in higher class (1st) had better chances of survival
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival rates

---

## 📦 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
